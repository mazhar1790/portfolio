    title: "Enterprise RAG Document Intelligence System",
    content: `At SCAD (Statistics Centre Abu Dhabi) in 2025, Mazhar designed and built an Enterprise RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) Document Intelligence System. The challenge was that analysts spent 2+ hours manually searching through 100,000+ policy and statistical documents. The solution used Azure OpenAI GPT-4o with a hybrid retrieval pipeline combining BM25 keyword search and Pinecone vector search, with Cohere cross-encoder re-ranking. Key results: document research time reduced from 2 hours to 10 seconds (95% reduction), 5,000+ queries processed monthly, 92% accuracy validated by domain experts, and GPT-4o API costs cut by 65% through intelligent context compression. The system processes documents in both Arabic and English.`,

Second, he bridges AI and full-stack engineering — he designs the AI pipeline AND builds the application around it. Third, he works in government/enterprise contexts where reliability, security, and Arabic language support matter more than novelty. Fourth, he has a 15-year foundation in software architecture that prevents common AI-hype mistakes. Fifth, he measures outcomes: every project he describes has concrete metrics (time saved, cost reduced, accuracy achieved).`,

    title: "Working principles and philosophy",
    content: `Mazhar's core operating principles: (1) Measure or it didn't happen — every AI feature ships with baseline metrics and a clear definition of success. (2) RAG beats fine-tuning for enterprise knowledge — knowledge changes faster than models can be retrained. (3) The bottleneck is never the model — it's chunking strategy, retrieval quality, and prompt design. (4) Arabic-first design — government systems in the UAE must handle Arabic as a primary language, not an afterthought. (5) Boring infrastructure wins — proven Azure services over cutting-edge but unstable open-source alternatives for production.`,

    content: `The stack composition demonstrates Mazhar's engineering principles: (1) Best-of-tier for each job — Groq for fast LLM, Cohere for rerank, Pinecone for vectors, Gemini for embeddings. Each is independently the best in its category and they compose cleanly. (2) Graceful degradation — if Cohere is missing the API falls back to pure vector retrieval. If any key is missing the feature degrades but the site never breaks. (3) Cost discipline — even if traffic pushed a tier, the next step is $20-50/month, still cheaper than one hour of a human analyst. (4) Show, don't tell — exposing the cost trade-offs publicly is itself a signal of engineering judgement.`,

    title: "How the RAG document intelligence system was built (timeline)",
    content: `The RAG document intelligence system at SCAD was built in 5 phases over 3 months. Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): discovery — interviewed 12 analysts across 4 departments and discovered 60% of queries were semantic, not keyword-based. Phase 2 (Weeks 3-6): three prototypes; the first two failed; v3 combined hybrid retrieval + reranking and crossed 85% accuracy. Phase 3 (Weeks 7-8): built a 200-question gold-standard evaluation harness with domain experts. Phase 4 (Weeks 9-12): production hardening — citations, Arabic, permissions, observability. Phase 5 (Month 4+): launched soft to 20 analysts, then org-wide. Cost dropped 65% over 6 months through prompt and context optimization.`,

    title: "Key architecture decisions in the RAG system",
    content: `Four critical decisions in the RAG system: (1) Hybrid retrieval (BM25 + vector) over pure semantic — pure vector missed exact terms like numbers and acronyms; RRF fusion lifted NDCG@5 by 14 points. (2) Semantic chunking over fixed-token chunking — splitting on section boundaries improved accuracy by ~20% before touching the model. (3) Cross-encoder reranking with Cohere rerank-v3 — reduced GPT-4 context window costs by 65% while improving precision. (4) Citation-by-default in the prompt — structured [SOURCE:doc_id,page_n] tagging turned the system from "helpful" to "trustworthy."`,

    id: "case-nl-sql-decisions",
    category: "project",
    title: "Key architecture decisions in the NL-to-SQL platform",
    content: `Key decisions in the conversational analytics platform: (1) Schema-aware context injection over fine-tuning — dynamic schema injection means the system updates when the database does, with zero retraining. (2) Read-only DB user with row-level security — defence in depth means even a prompt-injected model cannot mutate data or cross tenants. (3) Execution-aware repair loop — when generated SQL fails, the error goes back to the model with schema context for a corrected attempt; this lifted accuracy by 13 points (from 72% to 85%).`,
  },
  {
    id: "case-vision-decisions",
    category: "project",
    title: "Key architecture decisions in the Vision AI pipeline",
    content: `Key decisions in the Vision AI pipeline: (1) Azure Document Intelligence + GPT-4 Vision (not just one) — ADI handles structured forms cheaply; GPT-4V handles unstructured chaos; routing by document type uses each model where it's strongest. (2) Per-field confidence scores — without per-field confidence the only options are "trust everything" or "review everything"; confidence-gated review is what makes 80% automation safe. (3) Strict JSON schema output — downstream systems break on shape changes; schema-enforced output prevents silent extraction errors from corrupting the data warehouse.`,
  },
  {
    id: "lessons-production-ai",
    category: "approach",
    title: "Lessons learned from shipping production AI",
    content: `Lessons Mazhar took from shipping production AI systems: (1) Evaluation infrastructure pays for itself within a month — build it first, not last. (2) Users prefer accurate uncertainty over confident hallucination — teach the model to say "I don't know." (3) Chunking strategy and prompt design move the needle 10x more than picking the latest model. (4) The repair loop (errors fed back to the model) is more powerful than picking a bigger model. (5) Schema design matters more than prompt design — bad column names break the model long before bad prompts do. (6) Two models with clear routing beat one expensive model trying to do everything. (7) Confidence scoring is the unsung hero of human-in-loop AI. (8) Arabic handwriting is still hard — reviewer UX matters more than chasing the last 5% accuracy.`,
