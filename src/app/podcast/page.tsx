      "I'm Mazhar Hayat. I'm an AI Solutions Architect based in Abu Dhabi with fifteen years of professional engineering experience. For the past three years I've been shipping production large language model systems for government — retrieval-augmented generation over a hundred thousand documents, natural-language to SQL across eight databases, and a vision pipeline that processes thousands of forms a day. Before that, twelve years of full-stack and team leadership at the Ministry of Human Resources, TRG Tech, and NETSOL. I'm available from June 2026 for senior individual contributor, principal, or hands-on tech lead positions. Remote, hybrid in the UAE, or relocation for the right role. If any of that sounds relevant, there are several ways to reach me on this site.",

      "The flagship system I shipped at the Statistics Centre Abu Dhabi is a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline over a hundred thousand internal documents. Statistical reports, methodology papers, census documentation, regulatory frameworks. Let me walk through how it works. Ingestion uses semantic chunking — paragraphs grouped by topic similarity rather than character count, so context stays coherent. Every chunk gets embedded by Azure OpenAI's text-embedding model and stored in Pinecone with rich metadata: source document, page number, author, date, classification. At query time we do hybrid retrieval — semantic search plus BM25 keyword search — fused with reciprocal rank fusion. The top twelve candidates go through a cross-encoder reranker that re-scores them based on the actual question. We pick the top five. Those five chunks are stitched into a prompt with strict instructions: cite or refuse. The model — GPT-4 in production — must cite which chunk every claim comes from. If no chunk supports an answer, it must refuse rather than hallucinate. The whole pipeline runs in under two seconds at the ninety-fifth percentile. We track accuracy on a fifty-question gold set that re-runs on every release. Currently sitting at ninety-two percent. The system has been in production for eight months. Hasn't needed me in three.",

    script:
      "Three lessons from shipping AI to non-technical users in production. Lesson one: confidence scoring is non-negotiable. Every model output needs a confidence score, and you need to design your UI around what happens below the threshold. The Vision AI pipeline I built routes low-confidence extractions to a human reviewer. Without that gate, you ship a system that's right ninety percent of the time and silently wrong ten percent of the time. Users lose trust fast. Lesson two: evals beat demos. Anyone can build a demo that wows in a meeting. Almost nobody builds the gold-set evaluation harness that proves the system still works six months later. The eval harness is what separates a prototype from a system. Lesson three: cite by default. If your LLM produces text without citations, users have no way to verify it. Citations turn the AI from an oracle into a research assistant. They also dramatically reduce hallucination because the model learns it has to ground every claim. Three lessons. One pattern: trust is the product.",

One: an organisation that believes evals matter — that measures AI quality the way engineers measure latency. Two: a problem where my pattern fits — production LLM systems with real users, ideally in a regulated, document-heavy, or bilingual environment. I've earned that scar tissue and I can move fast there. Three: a team that ships. I want to write code, not just decks. What I'm not looking for: roles that are a hundred percent strategy or management. I love mentoring engineers, but I want to keep my hands on the keyboard. Also not interested in moving away from production AI back into general full-stack. I've found the work that fits me; I want to do more of it. If you have something that matches — let's talk.",
